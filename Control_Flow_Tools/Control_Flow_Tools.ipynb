    "# Control Flow Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "A program’s control flow is the order in which the program’s code executes. The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls. This section covers the if statement and for and while loops.\n",

    "## 5.1 - while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lessons, we have seen a few examples of basic while loop. Here is a formal expression of a while loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "while Conditional statement:\n",
    "    main statement\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    backup statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **conditional statement** in the while loop is a boolean evaluation which returns either True or False value.  As long as the condition is True, the execution of the main statement(s) will continue to repeat. Once the condition hits False, while loop will execute the backup statement(s) under **else** condition and exit the while loop. If the condition fails to be True in the first evaluation, it automatically execute the backup statement and exit the while loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main statement and backup statement can be one or multiple statements.  Each line of statement should be indented by the same whitespaces under the condition statement. We have seem the format in the previous lesson:\n",

    "# while loop example\n",
    "n = 9\n",

    "\n",
    "**break** and **continue** statements can alter the flow of a normal loop and are commonly used for control of the program flows.  The **break** statement terminates the loop and force an exist from the main body of the loop and the alternative statement (such as else statement). The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **if**, **elif**, and **else** statement is used in Python to execute a code when a certain condition is satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the condition statement syntax:\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "if Condition 1:\n",
    "    Body of statement(s) 1\n",

    "    Body of statement(s) 2\n",

    "    Body of statements(s) n-1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    Body of statement(s) n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **elif** is short for **else if**.  It allows us to check for multiple expressions.  If the first condition is met, the body of statement under condition 1 is executed.  If condition 1 is failed to be True, it checks the condition of the next elif condition and so on.  If all the condition are False, the body of statement under else is executed. The structure of the code is the similar to while loop, where the body of statement(s) under each condition is indented.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check out some simple examples here:\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "# Check if n is above 100\n",
    "if n > 100:\n",
    "    result = \"success\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    result = \"failed\"\n",

    "# We can also use one line of code to complete the above task in Python\n",
    "result = \"success\" if n > 100 else \"failed\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages have the similar syntax sturcture to our last example.  For instance, in C language the syntax will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` C\n",
    "result = n>100?\"success\":\"failed\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For advance user, it is often case that they would sacrifice the readability of the code for cleanliness (shorter code).  However, it's recommended to the beginners to focus on traditional syntax before adopting to the simplified syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body statement after the if condition is mandatory, but we can use a Python keyword \"**pass**\" to skip the body statement and not taking any action under the condition. **pass** can be used in any loop operation, which nothing will be executed and automatically jump to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use a if statement to check if x is greater than or equal to 5\n",
    "if x < 5:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater or equal to 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python does not have **switch-case** statement.  In most cases, if/elif/else conditional statement is good enough to handle the day-to-day operations in Python.

    "\n",
    "**Generators**, are similar to **list comprehesions**, are used to create iterators, but with a different approach. Generators are simple functions which return an interable set of items, one at a time, in a special way.  When an interation over a set of item starts using the for statement, the generator is run.  Once the generator's function code reaches a 'yield' statement, the generator yields its execution back to the for loop, returning a new value from the set. Below example demonstrates the use of a generator function:\n",

    "``` Python\n",

    "    print(s, end=\" \")  # return 1 4 9 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The generator syntax is almost the same as a list comprehension, except we are using the parentheses instead of square brackets. Also, list comprehension returns a new list, but the generator return a generator object, which can be iterated by a for loop.\n",
    "\n",

In the first lesson, we introduced the basic coding structure in Python. Statements are coded line by line in Python. In fact, if the statments are fairly short within a code block, we can put them in one line and separate them by semicolon (;). Similarly, after a conditional statement, we can continue the execution statements right after the colon (:) without jumping into the next line.\n",
