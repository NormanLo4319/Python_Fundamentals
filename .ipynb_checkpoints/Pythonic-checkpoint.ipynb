    "## Pythonic Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Python community, there is a term \"**Pythonic**\", which basically means that doesn't just get the syntex right but that follows the conventions of the Python community and uses the language in the way it is intended to be used.  When people discuss a line of code, they may express that \"this code is not Pythonic\", \"the Pythonic way to write this program is ...\", etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen some of the unique Python syntex in the Lesson 1 and 2.  Every syntex has its meaning and application: **indentation** is to provide a clean programming structure; slicing with **inclusive head and exclusive tail** is for the ease of understanding the code; **packing and unpacking** provides convenience for assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **Pythonic** reminds us to utilize these unique characteristics and features for writing a clean, readable, clear, and fluent programming code.  If we don't understand these characteristics and their objectives, we will only apply the logic from other programming lanaguages and not be able to optimize the use of Python, which makes it **Non-Pythonic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we covered how to swap two variables in Python.  If we are using the traditional programming logic, the code will be **Non-Pythnoic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "temp = a\n",
    "a = b\n",
    "b = temp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pythonic code for swapping two variables should be,\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python \n",
    "a, b = b, a \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For another instance, other programming language does not offer function return multiple values, so it's often the case to write some **Non-Pythonic** programming code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "info = get_user_info(id)\n",
    "print(\"Name\", info[0])\n",
    "print(\"Age\", info[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, code readers will have no idea about the data coming from info[0] and info[1] or they can only guess from other code block to guess what will return to info[0] and info[1]. Also, there is a high chance that a developer could mistaken the two and causing an error in the code or return an incorrect value from the program.  If we optimize the **packing and unpacking** feature in Python and assign the values to the meaningful variables, it would make the code more **Pythonic** (efficient)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic Code:\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "name, age = get_user_info(id)\n",
    "print(\"Name\", name)\n",
    "print(\"Age\", age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 5, we will be learning how to use the logical operators, such as **if** statement.  In traditional programming languages, we may write an **if** statement like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "if b > 10 and b <= a and a <= 20:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this lengthy code is not Pythonic.  Python allows us to write the logical operations more readable and easy to understand in a Pythonic style:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic Code:\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "if 10 < b <= a <= 20:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python supports membership test operations, we should optimize our code with this unique feature to write a cleaner and more readable program and stop applying the traditional coding logic by using **and** or **or** for comparing multiple conditions.  Below code is not Pythonic:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "if cmd == \"dir\" or cmd == \"cd\" or cmd == \"pwd\" or cmd == \"echo\":\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We should change it to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic Code:\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "if cmd in (\"dir\", \"cd\", \"pwd\", \"echo\"):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic not necessarily means a shorter code.  If we try to write some code that is hard to read or difficult for others to understand, it is also Non-Pythonic.  Such as the following code for calcuating the standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "math.sqrt(sum(pow(x-(sum(data) /len(data)), 2) for x in data) / len(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below code is a bit longer, but it's more readable and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic Code:\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "mean = sum(data) / len(data)\n",
    "variance = sum(pow(x-mena,2) for x in data) / len(data)\n",
    "std = math.sqrt(variance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, **Pythonic** is just an subjective view and there is no objective measure to evaluate.  More importantly, when we start programming, we should always review the readablility, complexity, maintainability, and cleanliness of the code. Try to optimize your code with the unique built-in functions and syntax characteristics, which will lead us naturally writing the **Pythonic** program."
