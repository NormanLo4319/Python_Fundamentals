We can inquire a **value** from a dictionary by using the **key**, therefore, **key** is essential in dictionary data structure. A pair of braces (curly brackets) reates an empty dictionary: { }.

Unfortunately, list is a **mutable** Python object, which means it cannot be used as \"key\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this is to use an **immutable** list object, **tuple**. Once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed or updated.  Therefore, it is a suitable object to be a key of a dictionary.  However, there is one more condition to be qualified as key. A dictionary key has to be hashable.  Any hashable object or element can be interpreted by the __hash__() method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though tuple itself is immutable, but mutable objects can be assigned to a tuple, such as a list.  When an element changes in a tuple, the hash value will also changed. Therefore, this kind of tuple cannot be the key of a dictionary.  The conclusion is that when we are using a tuple as key of a dictionary, we need to make sure all the elements in the tuple are all immutable.\n",

    "# Create a matrix using two pairs of square brackets\n",
    "matrix = [[3, 0, -2, 11], [0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0 ,-5]]\n",

    "# Extract element(s) from a matrix\n",
    "# matrix[rownum][colnum]\n",
    "element = matrix[1][3]\n",
    "element  # return -2\n",

    "In some applications, a matrix could have thousands of rows and columns, which multiply up to millions of elements.  In such matrix, there could be many elements with value of zero.  For saving the memory, this type of matrix will usually be stored without the zero value and they are called \"sparse matrices\".\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we would like to introduce how to use a dictionary as **cache**.  A cache is a data structure, which stores the results of an operation for later use, so it avoids the same calculations repeat multiple times.  Memorization allows to optimize a Python function by caching its output based on the parameters supply to it.  Suppose we need a function called \"sole\", which needs three arguments to return the result:\n",

    "This sole function is time consuming especially when it needs to be called thousands times, the operation is extremely inefficient.  \n",

    "Assume that the sole() function has some predicted combination of parameters and each combination will be called for multiple times, for instance, sole(12, 20, 6) is one of the combinations, but this combination needs to be callled hundreds times.  To speed up the processing, we can use a tuple (12, 20, 6) as the key and stores the result values into a dictionary, so the calculation needs to be store once and it can be extracted from the dictionary for later use.  The code will look like this:\n",

    "If you are concerned about the efficiency use of a dictionary and hesitate to use it, you should not. It is true that the traditional data structures such as \"list\" is more efficient than dictionary, but the difference is marginal because it has been optimized in many ways in the recent years. In fact, many of the Python built-in functions are based on the dictionary data structure.  It would be wise to utilize this data structure whenever it's applicable in your code because of it's flexibility and features.  Only choose an alternative when a dictionary is significantly slowing down the processing speed in your program. "
