First of all, many people refer the Python \"list\" as an array in other programming language, however, You should know that the Python \"list\" is a much flexible and powerful data structure compares to an array in different programming language.  A \"tuple', on the other hand, is basically an **immutable** list.  We are going to discuss some situation when we need an immutable list, tuple.  \n",

    "In this section, we discuss the common **methods** of list **object**. To programming beginners, the concept of **method** could be very vague. If we image a Python **object** is actually a physical object, **method** is bacially the action of the **object**.  It's similar to when we are using a **verb** pair with a **noun** in a sentence.  Python is an object oriented program.  A method defines the behavior of the object and is an actiona that an object is able to perform.\n",

    "z = [4, 7, 9] * 2\n",
