# Python Fundamentals
In this repository, we try to explore the world of Python and learn how to become a "Pythonic" programmer.  We use ["Jupyter Notebook"](https://jupyter.org/) as our execution environment for this project.  

## Installing Jupyter Notebook
Before starting to write code in Python, we need to first setup the development environment, which include an interpreter, standard library, and other environment settings.  For people who want to use the official Python development environment, you can download it from Python official web page, www.python.org.  However, the IDLE (Integrated Developmnet and Learning Environment) provided by Python is not the most intuitive one to use for developers or programmers.  Here we are using a more complete standard platform called "Anaconda" as our development environment.

We can download Anaconda from the official web page, www.anaconda.com, by click on "Download".
