    "\n",
    "strip( ), lstrip( ), and rstrip( ) are the simple methods used for removing the whitespaces starting or ending in a string.  lstrip( ) and rstrip( ) are used to remove the left whitespace and the right whitespace respectively. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "x = \" Hello, World\\t\\t\"\n",
    "x.strip()  # return 'Hello, World'\n",
    "\n",
    "x.lstrip()  # return 'Hello, World\\t\\t'\n",
    "\n",
    "x.rstrip()  # return ' Hello, World'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Whitespaces may be interpreted differently in different operation systems, but we can check the space characters using string.whitespace from **string** package.  Here is the returned whitespace characters from Window operation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "import string\n",
    "string.whitespace  # return the whitespace characters\n",
    "\n",
    "\" \\t\\n\\r\\v\\f\"  # return ' \\t\\n\\r\\x0b\\x0c'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above returned values **\\x0b** and **\\x0c** translate as the **line tabulation** and **form feed**.  We should be careful not to change any of the whitespace characters in the orginal string when using strip( ) because it may return an unexpected result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to assign the removed characters to a variable and using strip( ), lstrip( ) and rstrip( ) to remove the specific characters from a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "x = \"www.python.org\"\n",
    "x.strip(\"w\")  # return '.python.org'\n",
    "\n",
    "x.strip(\"gor\")  # return 'www.python.'\n",
    "\n",
    "x.strip('.gorw')  # return 'python'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Regardless the order of the characters in the string, strip( ) removes all the characters specified in the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "rstrip( ) would be extremely helpful when we are dealing with text file with multiple lines, which can effectively remove all the newline whitespaces at the end of each line.  "

    "\n",
    "Since string is an immutable object in Python, so we cannot modify it as a list object.  Even though we can apply the methods mentioned above to create a new string object, but sometime we still want to modify it directly.  We can achieve this objective by changing a string object to a list then modify the characters in the list and finally change the modified list of characters back into a string.  Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Change the string to a list of characters\n",

    "# Reverse the characters order\n",

    "# Join the characters in the list with no space\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We can also use tuple( ) to transform the string into a tuple and use \"\".join( ) to switch it back to string.  However, neither of the two are suggested methods for text processing in Python because the process continues to create and delete string object, which is a relatively expensive method.  The efficiency be significantly affected when the program is designed for processing a massive string objects (hundreds of million words)."

    "``` Python\n",

    "'the list x is ' + repr(x)  # return 'the list x is [1, 2, [3, 4]]'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use repr( ) to transfrom a list object to a string and casted with another string.  If we use \"+\" operator to join the string with a list object, Python will get confused of what you are trying to do and return an error message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "repr() bascially can be used to transform any Python object into a string.  We can also try to use repr( ) to interpret some of the built-in objects in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "repr(len)  # return '<built-in function len>'\n",

    "repr(tuple)  # return \"<class 'tuple'>\"\n",

    "\n",
    "repr( ) does not return the built-in code of the function, but only return a string value that specifyies len( ) is a built-in function in Python.

    "\n",
    "Python also has a built-in function str( ) to transform different object to a string.  The difference between repr( ) and str( ) is that repr( ) returns a Python object called \"formal string represetnation\", which means we can also re-generate the orginal object with the given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, str( ) returns a Python object called \"informal string representation\", which we cannot use it to re-generate the orginal object.  In a simple term, str( ) return a string value for reading and repr( ) return a string for Python to interpret.  We can experience it with the following example:\n",

    "For beginners, it is often the case people thought the two are the same and getting confused when to use one, but not the other.  It becomes handy when we need to identify the object type in our code.  In many cases, we would apply str( ) for creating readable string in the code and use repr( ) if we need to figure out the object representation."

    "## 3.8 - Formatting a String\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 has three different methods for formatting strings.  In this section we first introduce format( ).  format( ) is a powerful formatting tool in Python, which provides multiple ways to format textual data into string.  We demonstrates a few basic formatting examples here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Placeholders and Numbered Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "format( ) is method for string object.  The most common way to use it is to create an empty placeholders in a string and fill in the placeholders with the arguments in the format( ) function by its order.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "# Using empty placeholders\n",
    "\"{} is the {} of {}\".format(\"Ambrosia\", \"food\", \"the gods\")  # return 'Ambrosia is the food of the gods'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using empty placeholders with curly brackets in the string\n",
    "\"{{Ambrosia}} is the {} of {}\".format(\"food\", \"the gods\")  # return '{Ambrosia} is the food of the gods'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the curly brackets { } are the placeholders in the orginal string, which are replaced by the sub-string values by their order. When a string contain curly brackets, we need to make sure it has double curly brackets to include the original curly brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only string can be passed into format( ).  Any Python object can be passed into format( ) and Python will transform it to string.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "# Passing in number and mathematical operation to format( )\n",
    "\"{} + {} = {}\".format(1, 2, 1+2)  # return '1 + 2 = 3'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Passing in a list object to format( )\n",
    "x = [1, 2 , 'three']\n",
    "\"The {} contains: {}\".format(\"list\", x)  # return \"The list contains: [1, 2, 'three']\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the number indexes to appoint the sub-strings to the specific placeholders in a string.  Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "# Use number indexes\n",
    "\"{2} is the {0} of {1}\".format(\"food\", \"the gods\", \"Ambrosia\")  # return 'Ambrosia is the food of the gods'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have three number indexes {0}, {1}, and {2}, which are used to identify the position of the sub-strings.  Since the placeholders depends on the nubmer index, we can also repeat these indexes using format( ) method.  Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "# Repeat the indexes\n",
    "\"{0} is not {1} and {1} is not {0}\".format(\"abc\", \"cba\")  # return 'abc is not cba and cba is not abc'\n",
